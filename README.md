This app was developed by me to demonstrate my Angular 4+ skills in the following areas:
 - implementing appropiate structure using main modules and feature modules
 - cross-component comunication using subjects
 - routing with child routes and canActivate guards
 - http client
 - template driven and reactive forms
 - custom pipes (search, dropdown pipe)
 - ngrx (observables, subjects)

 A great chunk of work was attributed to enabling storing the data on the server using google firebase service and building the autenthication modules so  be sure to log in/register to experience this functionalities i built;)
